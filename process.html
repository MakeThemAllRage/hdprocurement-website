            Our approach is straightforward: clarify the scope, manage the
            administrative work at each stage, and keep communication simple and
            documented.

              <h3>1. Discovery &amp; alignment</h3>
              <p>
                We start with a conversation to define the types of work you are
                interested in, the locations you prefer, and the timelines that
                make sense for your team.

              <h3>2. Monitoring &amp; screening</h3>
              <p>
                We configure SAM.gov searches and related resources to identify
                opportunities that meet those criteria, then provide concise
                summaries for your review.

              <h3>3. Bid development</h3>
              <p>
                For approved opportunities, we organize the solicitation into a
                practical task list, support drafting, and coordinate with
                subcontractors where applicable.

              <h3>4. After submission</h3>
              <p>
                Once a bid is submitted, we help track status, coordinate
                clarifications, and support the transition into performance if an
                award is made.
