          <h2>Prime contracting and coordination built around clear responsibility.</h2>
          <p>
            HD Procurement LLC is structured to serve as the accountable prime on projects
            that involve more than one firm. Our services focus on planning, sourcing, and
            day-to-day coordination so owners, agencies, and partners have a single point of
            responsibility.

            <h3>Prime contracting &amp; project oversight</h3>
            <p>
              Acting as the prime, we lead contracts and expectations so there is a clear
              “owner” of the work being performed, even when several companies are involved.

            <h3>Subcontractor &amp; vendor sourcing</h3>
            <p>
              We look for qualified local companies that match the technical needs, scale,
              and schedule of each project, then bring them into a coordinated plan with
              defined roles and expectations.

            <h3>Procurement coordination</h3>

              We help organize the purchasing of services and materials so requirements,
              timelines, and responsibilities are understood by everyone involved.

              schedules, and communication aligned under one accountable prime.
