          <h2>Prime contracting and procurement built around coordination.</h2>
          <p>
            HD Procurement LLC is structured to serve as the prime contractor and central
            coordination point for projects that involve multiple subcontractors and vendors.
            Even as we begin building our portfolio, our focus remains the same: reliable
            organization and clear responsibility.
